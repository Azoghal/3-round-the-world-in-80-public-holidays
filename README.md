# Round the world in 80 holidays

Hopefully a fun little investigation into how many consecutive public holidays you can chain together by travelling.

Extra questions:
- What if you can't repeat a country?
- What if you include regional holidays too?
- What if you can only travel across land borders?
    - Allowing for chaining multiple countries in the same day
- How many days of extra holiday would you need to take to achieve a full year off?
